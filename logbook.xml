<p> On Sunday 22nd of May I cleaned up the code and added the function to allow the user to modify the kernel config. Additionally, I replaced the variable name for COUNT with KERNSUFFIX. Further progress with documentation was made. </p>
<p> On Tuesday 24th of May I added code to catch broken values of the AUTOKERNVERB variable, ensuring that if declared the value is set to "v". Also I fixed a typo. </p>

		<p> Term 2 Week 4 Log </p>
<p> On Tuesday 17th of May I fixed a typo which prevented the verbose mode function from running. </p>
<p> On Wednesday 18th of May I removed the code for the commented code for silent mode as it was not functioning as intended. Additionally, the documentation for silent mode in the manual page was removed accordingly. I also implemented code to detect the user's system architecture (x86, arm64 etc) and install the correct kernel, as previously the program was limited to installing a kernel for the x86_64 architecture. </p>
<p> On Friday 20th of May I added a function to create and read a configuration file for the program, as well as creating an example configuration file. </p>
<p> Next week I hope to make significant progress on documentation. </p>

		<p> Term 2 Week 3 Log </p>
<p> On Saturday 7th of May, I fixed various typos as well as removed the functions regarding silent mode as it was causing issues and needed to be revised at a later date. </p>
<p> On Sunday 8th of May, I modified the subprogram names as they were conflicting with sections of code and causing code loops. Additionally, I added the code to update the bootloader and fixed a few typos. </p>
<p> On Monday 9th of May, I added functions to check the system for the necessary dependencies along with a few typos. Later that day, more dependencies were added, more typos were fixed, indents were modified and the getopts (get options) section was moved. Furthermore, I wrote the manual page and added code to interpret it. </p>
<p> On Tuesday 10th of May, the dependency list was updated and the code was given a general clean which found a few typos. Additionally, I set up a virtual machine to test the program in, which will also be used to film the demonstration video. </p>
<p> On Thursday 12th of May bugfixes were applied regarding the getopts section of code, as well as adding the functions to install the latest kernel version or to install a kernel version specified with -k. </p>
<p> On Friday 13th of May, certain areas of code were modified to ensure the program exited when intended, such as at errors. Additionally, portions of code were substituted for subprograms and vice versa. </p>
<p> Next week I hope to make significant progress on documentation, fix the silent function, implement an architecture compatibility check and create the framework for the configuration file. </p>

<p> Week 6 Log </p>
<p> On tues 1st march I moved the KERNDIR code i added from last week. Also I added some code to interpret options and arguments, still needs a bit of work. Grouped sections of program into subprograms/modules. </p>
<p> On wed 2nd march I added the prompt to obtain a kernel version from the user and saved it as a variable, additionally I added code to allow for kernel versions other than v5.x.x to be used. Later that afternoon I made some revisions to the download system, fixing POSIX shell compatibility and debloating code</p>
<p>Next week I will polish code, apply teacher's feedback to powerpoint/proposal and add the placeholders for the user queries.</p>

	<![CDATA[ <p>The second RSS Feed / logbook post</p> <p>On samonday (14th) I created the autoKern file (the actual script) and coded the very basic commands used for the kernel build process. <p> Wednesday (16th) I added alternative commands for the option of verbose output. Obtained feedback from teacher, three main points were: </p>
		<p> 1. define a particular group that the project aims at for end users, and obtain an interview transcript with end users to further discern program requirements </p>
		<p> 2. Adjust project proposal to allow for a simpler understanding of technical jargon and processes </p>
		<p> 3. Film and share a video demo of the final product of the program to demonstrate usage and screen layout </p>
		<p> Thursday (17th) I then added a function to silence the program's output, however I am not super happy with the way this was executed, and will hopefully revise this system. Friday (18th) I modified the code to account for kernel versions and (some) file overwrites, there is a bit more that needs to be done in this area as some conflicts will still occur, but the idea is there and it works fine in most situations. </p>
